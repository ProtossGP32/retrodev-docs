    "text": "2023/10/21: Recap\nFollowing Retrosix’s wiki, the capacitors are replaced like this:\n\nPower board\n\nCapacitors are replaced with new electrolytic ones with the same rating\nThe only exception is the 820uF/6.3V one that has been replaced with a solid electrolytic capacitor of the same rating (does it make any difference compared to the standard electrolytic ones?)\n\nAccording to the data sheet, solid electrolytic capacitors have a low ESR and high ripple current\n\n\n\n\n\nPower board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad power board!\n\n\n\nPower board doesn’t properly provide 34V even after recapping. Using a functional audio board for the tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA kind advice on thru-hole capacitors removal!\n\n\n\nRemoving some capacitors proved to be quite challenging, even with an electrical desoldering pump. The trick to keep the vias intact is to reapply new solder several times to mix old solder with new one. Flux is indispensable to help transfer heat on already old and dry solder as well!\nIf a leg is stubbornly stuck, use some desoldering wick with new solder and a lot of flux to remove the excess inside the via by capilarity. Rinse and repeat until the leg is free!\nAlso use the desoldering wick to free the hole from solder before putting the new capacitors.\n\n\n\n\nAudio board\n\nAll capacitors are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\nC1 positive pad has been literally destroyed by corrosion. The new capacitor is soldered directly to the trace by exposing it a little bit\n\n\n\n\nAudio board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad audio board!\n\n\n\nAudio board still not working after recap! Sound is very dim from both speaker and jack, almost imperceptible due to the static noise. Using a functional audio board for the tests\n\n\n\n\nMain board\nBefore doing any heating work, and seeing the amount of corrosion in the zones near the capacitors, I decided to apply a generous amount of white vinegar to all of them and let it act during some minutes, while avoiding any leakage to the LCD.\nThis time, and following RetroSix Wiki advises, all capacitors have been first removed and then checked if the console reaches the Red Light Boot (RLB) state:\n\nComponents Needed for RLB\nIt’s worth noting that audio ICs, every aluminium capacitor, the LCD, MPU, Work RAM nor Video RAM or main crystal are involved or even needed to be soldered on the board to get to red light boot. Don’t waste your time on those until you get red light.\n\nWith the capacitors removed, both power board and audio board are re-connected and the console is powered up again:\n\nPower LED doesn’t turn on\nFluorescent tube lights up for a few seconds and after that\nAudio doesn’t work with a cartridge on\n\nWe haven’t reached the RLB state, so further troubleshooting is required before soldering the new capacitors.\n\nContinuity check:\n\nGood ground: OK, both R52 right pad and ASIC ground pad are connected to the ground plane\nPower board supply voltages: All pins are correctly connected to the pins on the Main Board and also are within the acceptable voltage ranges\nVRef Continuity: VRef continuity to ASIC is broken:\n\n1st point of discontinuity: via just below D2, connecting both layers\n\n\n\n\nEasyEDA - 2-ASIC schematic detail. Broken VRef continuity\n\n\n\nFixed by drilling a small hole in the via and soldering a capacitor leg through it\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - rear view. Fixed connectivity of VREF below D2\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - front view. Fixed connectivity of VREF below D2\n\n\nVOnOff network: VOnOff continuity to ASIC is broken:\n\n1st point of discontinuity: via just below D2, connecting both layers\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - Broken connectivity of VOnOff below D2\n\n\n\n\n\nEasyEDA - 2-ASIC schematic detail. Broken Vonoff continuity\n\n\n\nFixed by drilling a small hole in the via and soldering a capacitor leg through it\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - rear view. Fixed connectivity of VOnOff below D2\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - front view. Fixed connectivity of VOnOff below D2\n\n\nV5 network:\n\nASIC isn’t receiving 5V, as well as other points\nR38, C1, C4, C5, R1, R2: according to EasyEDA schematics, they should receive 5V, but they don’t seem to be connected to the 5V plane:\n\n\n\n\nEasyEDA - 2-ASIC schematic detail. Broken V5 continuity\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - Broken connectivity of V5\n\n\n\nFixed by soldering unpopulated ZD1 5V pad to R38 right pad\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - Fixed connectivity of V5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5V network - Incorrect fix!\n\n\n\nThis is properly detected and fixed later on as explained here. The procedure is kept for maintenance actions’ tracking.\n\n\n\nOther broken paths\n\nNetwork R39_2 on EasyEDA: broken connection between C37 bottom pad and D2/C50 top pads –&gt; Bottom layer trace isn’t connected to top layer\n\nFixed by drilling small holes in the vias and reconstructing the bridge with a capacitor leg\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - rear view. Fixed connectivity of R39_2\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - front view. Fixed connectivity of R39_2\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, when powering up the console it now lights up the Power LED for a second\n\nVReset network:\n\nNetwork R51_1 on EasyEDA: broken connection between R35 left pad and VReset pin on ASIC –&gt; Via next to D4 doesn’t connect both layers\n\nFixed by drilling a small hole in the via and soldering a capacitor leg through it\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - rear view. Fixed connectivity of VReset next to D4\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Board - front view. Fixed connectivity of VReset next to D4\n\n\n\n\nHere it seems that we reach the RLB state, even though sometimes it keeps turning down after a second\n\nCartridge slot:\n\nCartridge makes poor connection with the slot, being very difficult to reach a successful game boot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad cartridge slot\n\n\n\nEither check the contacts or replace it\n\n\nTesting the main board with a working audio board from another console we get sound from an inserted cartridge. At this point we can assure that the console works and we can proceed replacing the capacitors.\nOnce verified that the console reaches the RLB state, it’s time to solder the new capacitors. As with the previous VA-0 B0126683, these are the ceramic capacitors characteristics:\n\nAll original capacitors rated lower than 1uF are replaced with 1uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated lower between 1uF and 10uF are replaced with 10uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated higher than 10uF are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing recapped board pictures!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time I didn’t use soldering paste because in the previous repair the result wasn’t cleaner enough for me and although there wasn’t shorts it seemed like the paste might create a bridge under the cap. The results are cleaner caps and brighter soldering points.\nThe soldering technique used this time consisted on the following steps:\n\nTin one of the pads\nPin one side of the capacitor to that pad\nAfter that apply solder to the other side\nOnce done, rework the first pad by applying additional solder and adjusting the capacitor by applying heat to both pads if necessary\nUse a pair of tweezers to secure the capacitor in place while applying heat",

In order to fix this:\n\nAfter further inspection, the failure point is located in the 5V vias underneath the power supply connector:\n\n\n\nEasyEDA - 2-ASIC schematic detail.

A quick search Retrosix Discord channels mentioned that the issue might be with the Analog +5V and +2.5V paths.\n\nAccording to the schematics, a trace in the 5V layer connects R48 and C19 ANALOG+5V pads:\n\n\n\nEasyEDA - 2-ASIC schematic detail. ANALOG+5V network\n\n\nFurther testing shows that the vias are corroded and this connection is lost:\n\n\n\nMother Board - C19 faulty connection to ANALOG+5V\n\n\nOnce again, fixing the via is not an option, so R48 and C19 pads are connected with a small wire:\n\n\n\nMother Board - C19 connection to ANALOG+5V fixed\n\n\n\n\n\nCartridge slot contacts\nDue to inconsistency when booting games, the cartridge pins have been resoldered to ensure proper contact.

Without an oscilloscope there’s no way to check if the video signals are correct. A screen swap with a spare one from unit 030011013 (not documented) where a BennVenn IPS screen mod was installed hasn’t solved anything, so the issue might still be in the main board.\nThe original screen is kept but not yet reinstalled.\n\n\nRepairing time\n\n11 hours 20 minutes\n\n\n\nState on boot\n\nConsole enters the Red Light Boot state, required for further troubleshooting and repairs\n\nCheck of voltages is required\nPower board should be tested on other working units\nAudio board should be tested on other working units\n\nLCD turns on but image is very dim\nThe fluorescent tube lights up but brightness wheel acts weird\nWhen tested with other working audio boards, game sound works\n\nAudio is very dim\n\n\nIt seems as if the recap didn’t make any effect at all",

The trick to keep the pads intact is to reapply new solder to mix old solder with new one. Flux is indispensable to help transfer heat on already old and dry solder as well!\nPrior to dettach the capacitor from the board, use the desoldering wick to remove as much solder as possible between the pad and the capacitor leg. This will help reduce mechanical stress on the pad when snapping the glue beneath the capacitor.\n\n\n\n\nMain board\nFollowing RetroSix Wiki advises, all capacitors have been first removed and then checked if the console reaches the Red Light Boot (RLB) state:\n\nComponents Needed for RLB\nIt’s worth noting that audio ICs, every aluminium capacitor, the LCD, MPU, Work RAM nor Video RAM or main crystal are involved or even needed to be soldered on the board to get to red light boot. Don’t waste your time on those until you get red light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember this trick for surface-mount capacitors removal!\n\n\n\nPrior to dettach the capacitor from the board, use the desoldering wick to remove as much solder as possible between the pad and the capacitor leg. This will help reduce mechanical stress on the pad when snapping the glue beneath the capacitor.\n\n\nWith the capacitors removed, both power board and audio board are re-connected and the console is powered up again:\n\nPower LED turns on and keeps lighted up\nFluorescent tube also lights up but the screen doesn’t show any image\nAudio also works when putting a cartridge\n\nOnce verified that the console reaches the RLB state, it’s time to solder the new capacitors. As with the previous VA-0 B0126683, these are the ceramic capacitors characteristics:\n\nAll original capacitors rated lower than 1uF are replaced with 1uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated lower between 1uF and 10uF are replaced with 10uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated higher than 10uF are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\nC31 capacitor is always hard to deal with and the power connector has melted a little bit, but with the desolder wick trick the pads were intact after removal\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail\n\n\n\nThe rest of the left side capacitors didn’t present any issue when removing and replacing them, and the result is pretty clean\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Right side recap detail\n\n\nThe soldering technique used this time consisted on the following steps:\n\nTin one of the pads\nPin one side of the capacitor to that pad\nAfter that apply solder to the other side\nOnce done, rework the first pad by applying additional solder and adjusting the capacitor by applying heat to both pads if necessary\nUse a pair of tweezers to secure the capacitor in place while applying heat\n\n\n\nBattery contacts\nThe battery contacts have been soaked in white vinegar to remove as much corrosion as possible. The results are far from perfect as now they are rusted, but still functional:\n\n\n\nBattery contacts - Cleaned with white vinegar\n\n\nConnection cables have been replaced.

Replacing it with a 10kΩ potentiometer proves that the issue is indeed in the brightness wheel\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Gear - Brightness wheel verification\n\n\n\nSOLUTION: The brightness wheel has been replaced with the one from B0097296 as this console can be used as a donor one due to all its issues\n\nNow image brightness can be properly adjusted, but it isn’t homogeneous on all the screen: there’s a clear central vertical band that shows less brightness than the left and right side of the screen\nAlso, once the console is reassembled, the brightness wheel touches the shell, thus being a little bit hard to turn.

The new capacitor is soldered directly to the trace by exposing it a little bit\n\n\n\n\nAudio board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\nMain board\nBefore doing any heating work, and seeing the amount of corrosion in the zones near the capacitors, I decided to apply a generous amount of white vinegar to all of them and let it act during some minutes, while avoiding any leakage to the LCD.\nThis time, and following RetroSix Wiki advises, all capacitors have been first removed and then checked if the console reaches the Red Light Boot (RLB) state:\n\nComponents Needed for RLB\nIt’s worth noting that audio ICs, every aluminium capacitor, the LCD, MPU, Work RAM nor Video RAM or main crystal are involved or even needed to be soldered on the board to get to red light boot. Don’t waste your time on those until you get red light.\n\nWith the capacitors removed, both power board and audio board are re-connected and the console is powered up again:\n\nPower LED turns on and keeps lighted up\nFluorescent tube also lights up but the screen doesn’t show any image\nAudio also works when putting a cartridge\n\nOnce verified that the console reaches the RLB state, it’s time to solder the new capacitors. As with the previous VA-0 B0126683, these are the ceramic capacitors characteristics:\n\nAll original capacitors rated lower than 1uF are replaced with 1uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated lower between 1uF and 10uF are replaced with 10uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated higher than 10uF are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\nC31 capacitor is always hard to deal with. This time the left pad has been very damaged by corrosion and the capacitor is soldered directly to the trace by exposing it a little bit\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail\n\n\n\nThe same applies to C3. Here a solution would have been to solder that side of the capacitor to the same side of C4, but then again I opted for exposing the underneath trace and solder it there\nC1 also had damaged pads but with flux, the soldering iron, desoldering wick and patience, they have been pretty much recovered. However, during reparations, the underneath small traces have left exposed; to avoid any bridge, some kapton tape has been applied before soldering the new capacitor\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Right side recap detail\n\n\nThis time I didn’t use soldering paste because in the previous repair the result wasn’t cleaner enough for me and although there wasn’t shorts it seemed like the paste might create a bridge under the cap. The results are cleaner caps and brighter soldering points.\nThe soldering technique used this time consisted on the following steps:\n\nTin one of the pads\nPin one side of the capacitor to that pad\nAfter that apply solder to the other side\nOnce done, rework the first pad by applying additional solder and adjusting the capacitor by applying heat to both pads if necessary\nUse a pair of tweezers to secure the capacitor in place while applying heat",

Here we install the SDK locally instead of using a Docker image for building the project\n\nQuick installation steps: link\nCompile time is long, so let it do its thing\nSet the $MARSDEV environment variable in .bashrc like this: export MARSDEV=/home/$USER/mars\nCreate a softlink within the $MARSDEV path that points to the SGDK created on compile time within the Marsdev repository. This is required for later use in VS Code extensions\n\n\n\nInclude SGDK to Marsdev path\n\ncd $MARSDEV\nln -s /path/to/git/repository/marsdev/sgdk sgdk\n\n\n\n\nCompiling\nWe can use the following alternatives to compile our projects:\n\nLocally, previously compiling SGDK or Marsdev toolchains\nUsing a Docker image (Dockerfile provided in Stephane’s repository). Just follow these instructions to build your own SGDK docker image and use it to compile your code\n\nThis approach also uses Wine within the Docker container to launch SGDK\n\nUsing Doragasu, another Docker image. Again, just use these instructions to build your project\n\nThis approach uses native Linux compiler, much faster\n\n\nSome compile times comparison:\n\n\n\nApproach\nTime\n\n\n\n\nSGDK docker\n13.721s\n\n\nDoragasu docker\n6.952s\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\nWhen using Marsdev, the GDC for m64k (m68k-elf-gdb) isn’t compiled by default. Launch the following command from the git repository root path:\n\n\nCompiling m68k GDB\n\n# Install required dependencies\nsudo apt-get install libgmp-dev\n\nmake m68k-gdb\n\nTake note of the binary path as we’ll have to check it when configuring our text editor.\nWe also need an emulator to run the code and to properly attach when debugging. BlastEm is a relatively modern emulator with embedded debugger. Gens is another good option with very intuitive GUI for debugging purposes.\n\nBlastEm - Use nighly builds\n\nDownload the latest nightly build. At the moment of writing this article (2023/05/07), the available stable 0.6.2 version fails due to missing instructions\n\nVerified version: nightly build from 2023/04/03\n\nUncompress the file and add the resulting directory to your $PATH environment variable\n\nMake sure to update it in your .bashrc file",

Then check that the .vscode path has been created and make sure that both launch.json and settings.json point towards the right MARSDEV paths, else VS Code won’t include the SGDK headers to the project.\n\nDebug configuration\nIn order to properly debug using BlastEm, check the .vscode/launch.json file and make sure that everything points towards the correct paths:\n\nprogram: should be the ELF program created when compiling with the debug options enabled (Genesis Code: Compile for Debugging in the command palette).\n\nThis file must include the symbols\nWhen compiling with SGDK, the generated file is out/rom.out\n\nsourcefileMap: it must point to the SGDK src path, retrieved using the Marsdev make targets\nmiDebuggerPath: don’t touch it. Just make sure you compiled the m68k-elf-gdb as told in previous steps\nmiDebuggerArgs: make sure that the emulator name is correct and that it launches the out/rom.bin file\n\nOnce done, go to the Run and Debug option (CTRL + SHIFT + D), select the Debug with gdb remote profile and click on play. If a breakpoint has been set in your code, the Debug var should start to show some info:\n\n\n\nVS Code debugging a Hello World example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: create a VS Codium Docker image that already includes Marsdev installed",

Both are compatible with the container images we’ll build, but for convenience we’ll stick with docker and docker compose commands here. Feel free to swap them to podman and podman compose if you decide to use the latter\n\nArchitecture:\n\nWe’ll be deploying the server in a [Proxmox] Alpine LXC to make sure we use the least amount of resources for this and so we can respawn it easily if something goes wrong",
