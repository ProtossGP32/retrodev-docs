    "text": "Installing SGDK\nWe’ll be deploying the excellent and mature SGDK by Stephane Dallongeville, that allows to develop Mega Drive games in C language.\n\nDeveloping on Linux\nSGDK works natively on Windows, but there are options to make it work on Linux:\n\nUsing Wine\nUsing Marsdev. Here we install the SDK locally instead of using a Docker image for building the project\n\nQuick installation steps: link\nCompile time is long, so let it do its thing\nSet the $MARSDEV environment variable in .bashrc like this: export MARSDEV=/home/$USER/mars\nCreate a softlink within the $MARSDEV path that points to the SGDK created on compile time within the Marsdev repository. This is required for later use in VS Code extensions\n\n\n\nInclude SGDK to Marsdev path\n\ncd $MARSDEV\nln -s /path/to/git/repository/marsdev/sgdk sgdk\n\n\n\n\nCompiling\nWe can use the following alternatives to compile our projects:\n\nLocally, previously compiling SGDK or Marsdev toolchains\nUsing a Docker image (Dockerfile provided in Stephane’s repository). Just follow these instructions to build your own SGDK docker image and use it to compile your code\n\nThis approach also uses Wine within the Docker container to launch SGDK\n\nUsing Doragasu, another Docker image. Again, just use these instructions to build your project\n\nThis approach uses native Linux compiler, much faster\n\n\nSome compile times comparison:\n\n\n\nApproach\nTime\n\n\n\n\nSGDK docker\n13.721s\n\n\nDoragasu docker\n6.952s\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\nWhen using Marsdev, the GDC for m64k (m68k-elf-gdb) isn’t compiled by default. Launch the following command from the git repository root path:\n\n\nCompiling m68k GDB\n\n# Install required dependencies\nsudo apt-get install libgmp-dev\n\nmake m68k-gdb\n\nTake note of the binary path as we’ll have to check it when configuring our text editor.\nWe also need an emulator to run the code and to properly attach when debugging. BlastEm is a relatively modern emulator with embedded debugger. Gens is another good option with very intuitive GUI for debugging purposes.\n\nBlastEm - Use nighly builds\n\nDownload the latest nightly build. At the moment of writing this article (2023/05/07), the available stable 0.6.2 version fails due to missing instructions\n\nVerified version: nightly build from 2023/04/03\n\nUncompress the file and add the resulting directory to your $PATH environment variable\n\nMake sure to update it in your .bashrc file",

This extension is compatible with all previously mentioned compiling options, both Docker images and Marsdev.\nConfiguration:\n\nCheck Doragasu Image if you plan on using Doragasu GitLab image for building purposes\nSet docker as the Toolchain Type if you plan on using Docker images on build stage\nSet the $MARSDEV env variable\n\nCreating a new Mega Drive project is as simple as launching Genesis Code: create project from the Command palette. Then check that the .vscode path has been created and make sure that both launch.json and settings.json point towards the right MARSDEV paths, else VS Code won’t include the SGDK headers to the project.\n\nDebug configuration\nIn order to properly debug using BlastEm, check the .vscode/launch.json file and make sure that everything points towards the correct paths:\n\nprogram: should be the ELF program created when compiling with the debug options enabled (Genesis Code: Compile for Debugging in the command palette).\n\nThis file must include the symbols\nWhen compiling with SGDK, the generated file is out/rom.out\n\nsourcefileMap: it must point to the SGDK src path, retrieved using the Marsdev make targets\nmiDebuggerPath: don’t touch it. Just make sure you compiled the m68k-elf-gdb as told in previous steps\nmiDebuggerArgs: make sure that the emulator name is correct and that it launches the out/rom.bin file\n\nOnce done, go to the Run and Debug option (CTRL + SHIFT + D), select the Debug with gdb remote profile and click on play. If a breakpoint has been set in your code, the Debug var should start to show some info:\n\n\n\nVS Code debugging a Hello World example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: create a VS Codium Docker image that already includes Marsdev installed",

    "text": "2024/06/22: Recap\nFollowing Retrosix’s wiki, the capacitors are replaced like this:\n\nPower board\n\nA voltage check on the power board shows that 5V network outputs 5V at first but keeps draining until reaching 0V after some seconds\nCapacitors are replaced with new electrolytic ones with the same rating\nThe only exception is the 820uF/6.3V one that has been replaced with a solid electrolytic capacitor of the same rating (does it make any difference compared to the standard electrolytic ones?)\n\nAccording to the data sheet, solid electrolytic capacitors have a low ESR and high ripple current\n\n\n\n\n\nPower board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA kind advice on thru-hole capacitors removal!\n\n\n\nRemoving some capacitors proved to be quite challenging, even with an electrical desoldering pump. The trick to keep the vias intact is to reapply new solder several times to mix old solder with new one. Flux is indispensable to help transfer heat on already old and dry solder as well!\nIf a leg is stubbornly stuck, use some desoldering wick with new solder and a lot of flux to remove the excess inside the via by capilarity. Rinse and repeat until the leg is free!\nAlso use the desoldering wick to free the hole from solder before putting the new capacitors.\n\n\n\n\nAudio board\n\nAll capacitors are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\nC1 positive pad has been literally destroyed by corrosion. The new capacitor is soldered directly to the trace by exposing it a little bit\n\n\n\n\nAudio board - Capapacitors removed\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA kind advice on surface-mount capacitors removal!\n\n\n\nRemoving these surface-mount capacitors without proper care can damage the underlying pads and vias. The trick to keep the pads intact is to reapply new solder to mix old solder with new one. Flux is indispensable to help transfer heat on already old and dry solder as well!\nPrior to dettach the capacitor from the board, use the desoldering wick to remove as much solder as possible between the pad and the capacitor leg. This will help reduce mechanical stress on the pad when snapping the glue beneath the capacitor.\n\n\n\n\nMain board\nFollowing RetroSix Wiki advises, all capacitors have been first removed and then checked if the console reaches the Red Light Boot (RLB) state:\n\nComponents Needed for RLB\nIt’s worth noting that audio ICs, every aluminium capacitor, the LCD, MPU, Work RAM nor Video RAM or main crystal are involved or even needed to be soldered on the board to get to red light boot. Don’t waste your time on those until you get red light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember this trick for surface-mount capacitors removal!\n\n\n\nPrior to dettach the capacitor from the board, use the desoldering wick to remove as much solder as possible between the pad and the capacitor leg. This will help reduce mechanical stress on the pad when snapping the glue beneath the capacitor.\n\n\nWith the capacitors removed, both power board and audio board are re-connected and the console is powered up again:\n\nPower LED turns on and keeps lighted up\nFluorescent tube also lights up but the screen doesn’t show any image\nAudio also works when putting a cartridge\n\nOnce verified that the console reaches the RLB state, it’s time to solder the new capacitors. As with the previous VA-0 B0126683, these are the ceramic capacitors characteristics:\n\nAll original capacitors rated lower than 1uF are replaced with 1uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated lower between 1uF and 10uF are replaced with 10uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated higher than 10uF are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\nC31 capacitor is always hard to deal with and the power connector has melted a little bit, but with the desolder wick trick the pads were intact after removal\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail\n\n\n\nThe rest of the left side capacitors didn’t present any issue when removing and replacing them, and the result is pretty clean\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Right side recap detail\n\n\nThe soldering technique used this time consisted on the following steps:\n\nTin one of the pads\nPin one side of the capacitor to that pad\nAfter that apply solder to the other side\nOnce done, rework the first pad by applying additional solder and adjusting the capacitor by applying heat to both pads if necessary\nUse a pair of tweezers to secure the capacitor in place while applying heat\n\n\n\nBattery contacts\nThe battery contacts have been soaked in white vinegar to remove as much corrosion as possible. The results are far from perfect as now they are rusted, but still functional:\n\n\n\nBattery contacts - Cleaned with white vinegar\n\n\nConnection cables have been replaced. Original ones didn’t stick when applying new solder.",

Sound is very dim from both speaker and jack, almost imperceptible due to the static noise. Using a functional audio board for the tests\n\n\n\n\nMain board\nBefore doing any heating work, and seeing the amount of corrosion in the zones near the capacitors, I decided to apply a generous amount of white vinegar to all of them and let it act during some minutes, while avoiding any leakage to the LCD.\nThis time, and following RetroSix Wiki advises, all capacitors have been first removed and then checked if the console reaches the Red Light Boot (RLB) state:\n\nComponents Needed for RLB\nIt’s worth noting that audio ICs, every aluminium capacitor, the LCD, MPU, Work RAM nor Video RAM or main crystal are involved or even needed to be soldered on the board to get to red light boot. Don’t waste your time on those until you get red light.\n\nWith the capacitors removed, both power board and audio board are re-connected and the console is powered up again:\n\nPower LED doesn’t turn on\nFluorescent tube lights up for a few seconds and after that\nAudio doesn’t work with a cartridge on\n\nWe haven’t reached the RLB state, so further troubleshooting is required before soldering the new capacitors.\n\nContinuity check:\n\nGood ground: OK, both R52 right pad and ASIC ground pad are connected to the ground plane\nPower board supply voltages: All pins are correctly connected to the pins on the Main Board and also are within the acceptable voltage ranges\nVRef Continuity: VRef continuity to ASIC is broken:\n\n1st point of discontinuity: via just below D2, connecting both layers\n\n\n\n\nEasyEDA - 2-ASIC schematic detail.

At this point we can assure that the console works and we can proceed replacing the capacitors.\nOnce verified that the console reaches the RLB state, it’s time to solder the new capacitors. As with the previous VA-0 B0126683, these are the ceramic capacitors characteristics:\n\nAll original capacitors rated lower than 1uF are replaced with 1uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated lower between 1uF and 10uF are replaced with 10uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated higher than 10uF are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail\n\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Right side recap detail\n\n\nThis time I didn’t use soldering paste because in the previous repair the result wasn’t cleaner enough for me and although there wasn’t shorts it seemed like the paste might create a bridge under the cap. The results are cleaner caps and brighter soldering points.\nThe soldering technique used this time consisted on the following steps:\n\nTin one of the pads\nPin one side of the capacitor to that pad\nAfter that apply solder to the other side\nOnce done, rework the first pad by applying additional solder and adjusting the capacitor by applying heat to both pads if necessary\nUse a pair of tweezers to secure the capacitor in place while applying heat",

C3 and C4 vias\n\n\nProper testing shows that the vias are corroded and thus don’t connect neither to 5V nor GND:\n\n\n\nMother Board - C3 and C4 faulty connection to 5V and GND\n\n\nFixing the vias is not an option, so pads are connected to C1 5V and GND:\n\n\n\nMother Board - C3 and C4 connected to C1\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalog 5V issues\nThe sound output on this board had too much noise even with properly repaired audio boards. A quick search Retrosix Discord channels mentioned that the issue might be with the Analog +5V and +2.5V paths.\n\nAccording to the schematics, a trace in the 5V layer connects R48 and C19 ANALOG+5V pads:\n\n\n\nEasyEDA - 2-ASIC schematic detail.

Now games boot at first try:\n\n\n\nMother Board - Cartride slot resoldered\n\n\n\n\nScreen swap\nOriginal screen showed a dim image only when brightess wheel was set to a very specific position. Without an oscilloscope there’s no way to check if the video signals are correct. A screen swap with a spare one from unit 030011013 (not documented) where a BennVenn IPS screen mod was installed hasn’t solved anything, so the issue might still be in the main board.\nThe original screen is kept but not yet reinstalled.",

    "text": "2023/10/08: Recap\nFollowing Retrosix’s wiki, the capacitors are replaced like this:\n\nPower board\n\nCapacitors are replaced with new electrolytic ones with the same rating\nThe only exception is the 820uF/6.3V one that has been replaced with a solid electrolytic capacitor of the same rating (does it make any difference compared to the standard electrolytic ones?)\n\nAccording to the data sheet, solid electrolytic capacitors have a low ESR and high ripple current\n\n\n\n\n\nPower board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA kind advice on thru-hole capacitors removal!\n\n\n\nRemoving some capacitors proved to be quite challenging, even with an electrical desoldering pump. The trick to keep the vias intact is to reapply new solder several times to mix old solder with new one. Flux is indispensable to help transfer heat on already old and dry solder as well!\nIf a leg is stubbornly stuck, use some desoldering wick with new solder and a lot of flux to remove the excess inside the via by capilarity. Rinse and repeat until the leg is free!\nAlso use the desoldering wick to free the hole from solder before putting the new capacitors.\n\n\n\n\nAudio board\n\nAll capacitors are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\nC1 positive pad has been literally destroyed by corrosion. The new capacitor is soldered directly to the trace by exposing it a little bit\n\n\n\n\nAudio board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\n\nMain board\nBefore doing any heating work, and seeing the amount of corrosion in the zones near the capacitors, I decided to apply a generous amount of white vinegar to all of them and let it act during some minutes, while avoiding any leakage to the LCD.\nThis time, and following RetroSix Wiki advises, all capacitors have been first removed and then checked if the console reaches the Red Light Boot (RLB) state:\n\nComponents Needed for RLB\nIt’s worth noting that audio ICs, every aluminium capacitor, the LCD, MPU, Work RAM nor Video RAM or main crystal are involved or even needed to be soldered on the board to get to red light boot. Don’t waste your time on those until you get red light.\n\nWith the capacitors removed, both power board and audio board are re-connected and the console is powered up again:\n\nPower LED turns on and keeps lighted up\nFluorescent tube also lights up but the screen doesn’t show any image\nAudio also works when putting a cartridge\n\nOnce verified that the console reaches the RLB state, it’s time to solder the new capacitors. As with the previous VA-0 B0126683, these are the ceramic capacitors characteristics:\n\nAll original capacitors rated lower than 1uF are replaced with 1uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated lower between 1uF and 10uF are replaced with 10uF/50V ceramic capacitors\nAll original capacitors rated higher than 10uF are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Fully recapped\n\n\n\nC31 capacitor is always hard to deal with. This time the left pad has been very damaged by corrosion and the capacitor is soldered directly to the trace by exposing it a little bit\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail\n\n\n\nThe same applies to C3. Here a solution would have been to solder that side of the capacitor to the same side of C4, but then again I opted for exposing the underneath trace and solder it there\nC1 also had damaged pads but with flux, the soldering iron, desoldering wick and patience, they have been pretty much recovered. However, during reparations, the underneath small traces have left exposed; to avoid any bridge, some kapton tape has been applied before soldering the new capacitor\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Left side recap detail 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMain board - Right side recap detail\n\n\nThis time I didn’t use soldering paste because in the previous repair the result wasn’t cleaner enough for me and although there wasn’t shorts it seemed like the paste might create a bridge under the cap. The results are cleaner caps and brighter soldering points.\nThe soldering technique used this time consisted on the following steps:\n\nTin one of the pads\nPin one side of the capacitor to that pad\nAfter that apply solder to the other side\nOnce done, rework the first pad by applying additional solder and adjusting the capacitor by applying heat to both pads if necessary\nUse a pair of tweezers to secure the capacitor in place while applying heat",
