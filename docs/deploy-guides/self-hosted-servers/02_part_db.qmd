# Introduction

According to [_Part-DB docs_][part-db-docs]:

> [Part-DB][github-part-db] is an Open-Source inventory management system for your electronic components. It is installed on a web server and so can be accessed with any browser without the need to install additional software.

# Installation
## Docker compose

Follow the instructions in [this link][part-db-docker-compose] to deploy the required services for `part-db` to run. By default, Part-DB will use an internal SQLite database, but this can be changed to MariaDB, MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

```{.yaml filename="Docker compose" include=../../../projects/self-hosted-servers/parts-db/docker-compose.yaml}

```

::: {.callout-warning}
# TODO
Create a Docker compose that uses PostgreSQL instead. Use the `docker-compose.yaml` example for MySQL database as a starting point.
:::

# Management

::: {.callout-warning}
# TODO
Document how to manage parts, users, suppliers, etc...

## Enabling Information Providers

In order to use component information from providers, these must first be enabled through environment variables in your Docker Compose file.

### LCSC

- `PROVIDER_LCSC_ENABLED=1`: this allows Part-DB to use an unofficial API for searching components

### MOUSER

- `PROVIDER_MOUSER_KEY=<your-search-api-token>`: don't mistake this API token with the Purchase/Order API token available from your Mouser's User panel. In order to get the right token you must access [this page][mouser-api-search]:
  
  ![Mouser - User Panel: API search link][mouser-api-search-section]

  Or you can directly go to the [Search API register page][mouser-api-search-register]:
  
  ![Mouser - API search register page][mouser-api-search-register-form]

  Mouser will request you to fill a form and then it will send you a verification code; with this you'll receive an API token.
  
  Once configured the environment variable and the container is recreated (`docker compose up -d`), you should be able to search for Mouser's parts through keywords:
