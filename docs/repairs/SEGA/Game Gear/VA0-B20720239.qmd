## First boot
- Power LED turns on a few seconds and then it turns off
- The screen doesn't turn on and there's no sound either

# Maintenance
## 2024/10/27: Recap
Following [Retrosix's wiki](https://www.retrosix.wiki/capacitor-replacement-game-gear), the capacitors are replaced like this:

### Power board
- Power board with existing capacitors doesn't provide the expected voltages:
  - 5V: 1.78V
  - GND: GND
  - 1.28V: 1.26V
  - 9V (Battery input): 13.91V
  - 34V: 1.05V
  There might be an issue with the voltage regulator as there are signs of being resoldered

<!--
- Capacitors are replaced with new electrolytic ones with the same rating
- The only exception is the 820uF/6.3V one that has been replaced with a **solid electrolytic capacitor of the same rating** (does it make any difference compared to the standard electrolytic ones?)
    - According to the data sheet, solid electrolytic capacitors have a low ESR and high ripple current

## Bad power board!
Power board doesn't properly provide 34V even after recapping. Using a functional power board for the tests
:::

**Using a functional power board the console reaches Red Boot Light without issues.**

:::{.callout-note}
## A kind advice on thru-hole capacitors removal!
Removing some capacitors proved to be quite challenging, even with an electrical desoldering pump. The trick to keep the vias intact is to reapply new solder several times to mix old solder with new one. Flux is indispensable to help transfer heat on already old and dry solder as well!

If a leg is stubbornly stuck, use some desoldering wick with new solder and a lot of flux to remove the excess inside the via by capilarity. Rinse and repeat until the leg is free!

Also use the desoldering wick to free the hole from solder before putting the new capacitors.

### Audio board
- Testing already soldered capacitors, it doesn't seem to provide audio

## Bad audio board!
Audio board still not working after recap! Sound is very dim from both speaker and jack, almost imperceptible due to the static noise.

### Main board

Main board loads games and plays audio when using working power and audio boards, and it reaches the Red Light Boot ([RLB](https://www.retrosix.wiki/getting-to-red-light-boot-game-gear#V6Rgn)) state. Once verified that the console reaches the RLB state, it's time to solder the new capacitors.

Before doing any heating work, and seeing the amount of corrosion in the zones near the capacitors, I decided to apply a generous amount of white vinegar to all of them and let it act during some minutes, while avoiding any leakage to the LCD.

- C37 and C39 pads were heavily corroded. Further work on cleaning them was required:

  ![Main board - C37 and C39 corroded pads](../../../images/repairs/SEGA/Game%20Gear/VA0/B20720239/20241027_main_board_c37_and_c39_corroded_pads.jpg)

- During removal of old capacitors, C6 right pad broke when using a desoldering wick to remove the remaining corrosion contamination and solder:

  ![Main board - C6 pad destroyed](../../../images/repairs/SEGA/Game%20Gear/VA0/B20720239/20241027_main_board_c6_pad_destroyed.jpg)

As with the previous VA-0 [B0126683](VA0-B0126683.qmd), these are the ceramic capacitors characteristics:

- All original capacitors rated lower than 1uF are replaced with 1uF/50V ceramic capacitors
- All original capacitors rated lower between 1uF and 10uF are replaced with 10uF/50V ceramic capacitors
- All original capacitors rated higher than 10uF are replaced with 100uF/10V ceramic capacitors

## Missing picture of whole main board recapped!

![Main board - Right side recap detail](../../../images/repairs/SEGA/Game%20Gear/VA0/B20720239/20241027_main_board_recap_detail_right.jpg)

The soldering technique used this time consisted on the following steps:

- Tin one of the pads
- Pin one side of the capacitor to that pad
- After that apply solder to the other side
- Once done, rework the first pad by applying additional solder and adjusting the capacitor by applying heat to both pads if necessary
- Use a pair of tweezers to secure the capacitor in place while applying heat

Once recapped, test with working power and audio boards still don't show image on the screen.

### Repairing time

- 3 hours 30 minutes

### State on boot

- Console enters the [Red Light Boot state](https://www.retrosix.wiki/getting-to-red-light-boot-game-gear), required for further troubleshooting and repairs
- LCD doesn't show image
- The fluorescent tube lights up but changing brightness doesn't make a difference
- When tested with other working audio boards, game sound works

# Next steps

## Further checks on power board

- Maybe capacitors aren't correctly connected or there's a broken path
- Voltage regulator might be faulty
- Maybe other components (diodes) are also faulty?

## Further checks on audio board

- Maybe capacitors aren't correctly connected or there's a broken path

## Further checks on mother board

- Again, maybe some capacitor traces are broken or it's just a non-functional screen
- Check LCD traces, see if there's any discontinuity

:::{.callout-warning}
## Screen replacement
Game boots and there's sound, so unless there's a major flaw not detected, this is a good candidate for an IPS screen
